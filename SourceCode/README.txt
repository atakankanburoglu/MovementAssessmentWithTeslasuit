The two folders each contain the source code for the python and unity implementation. 

For starting the python application run main.py in a python environment. I suggest using Visual Studio as it is downloaded for the unity project anyways. 

I moved all data to the "EvaluationData/Isometric Exercise Assessment" Folder, if needed.
