 *  \section ts_unity_mocap_data_provider Mocap data provider
 *  The mocap module covers the job of manipulating mocap data, calibrating 
 *  and applying mocap data to a character or hand model.
 *  TsMotionProvider component is used as a source of motion data in an abstract level and is required by TsHumanAnimator. 
 *  TsLiveMotionProvider component is an implementation of TsMotionProvider that starts mocap data streaming from a device
 *  when that device is available and when the component is in the "enabled" state.

 *  \section ts_unity_suit_mocap Suit mocap
 *  TsHumanAnimator component applies mocap data given by Suit devices to animate the humanoid skeleton. 
 *  
 *  \image html human_animator.JPG
 *  
 *  TsAvatarSettings asset contains the configurable data that is used to transform the incoming mocap data 
 *  so that it applies to the target character model. This component should be attached to the model's root transform component.

 *  An example of suit mocap can be found here: `TS/Examples/Scenes/Mocap/SuitMocap.unity`

 *  \section ts_unity_glove_mocap Glove mocap
 *  TsHandAnimator component applies mocap data given by Glove devices to animate a hand skeleton. 
 *  This component should be attached to the model's root transform component.
